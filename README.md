Love was not the gorgeousiest girl. Love had dark, expressive eyes, and soft curvy teeth. The world told me I was fat
and sometimes dumb, but Love made me feel I was perfect. Love was not attractive, but when Love wore a red Mekhela 
Sador and a watch, I couldn't stop myself for falling for her. Love never said she liked me, but I felt it in the
way Love remembered the smallest things about me. Love hated confrotations. Love wsn't kind to pick fights. I 
would scold Love how she used to take a step back, just looking away and pretend it never happened. Love would
never say a word, and listen patiently to me. I would control Love to take care of herelf, to stop overthinking,
to be fearless. But Love never tell a word of preach.
Love never wanted to change me. Love was liberating for me.

Love taught me how to love. Love was apricity

But Love was also vulnerable. So vulnerable, that I ended up breaking Love/ Love ended up breaking me.

Anyway Happy Post Valentine's Love- Never be a Stranger..
